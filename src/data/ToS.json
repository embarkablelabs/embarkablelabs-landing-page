For the rest of this document, these will be referred to as Balsamiq Services.

Other Balsamiq products and services are covered by other agreements, as specified on Terms of Service & EULA. For clarity, any other product (e.g. a desktop, mobile, or web application) we provide that can be used in conjunction with the Balsamiq Services referenced above remains subject to these Terms.

This document is a sister-document to our Privacy Policy. Please make sure you read both carefully before accessing or using a Balsamiq Service.

Introduction
Most Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.

Because we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers, we decided to use plain English instead as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible.

Please don’t forget that we are real people: take a look at our company page to get to know us a little. We are not perfect, but we’re trying our hardest, because we genuinely care about your success.

When you read Balsamiq or we below, it refers to Balsamiq as defined in the Who We Are section of our Privacy Policy.

Our subscription Services include the concept of a Site or Space Owner, or Administrator. For the rest of this document, these will collectively be referred to as Owners.

Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please get in touch!

Using Our Services Means Accepting These Terms
By accessing or using a Balsamiq Service in any way, whether you are visiting our websites, have created your own account or are invited to someone else’s company account, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document, as well as our Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document and our Privacy Policy, do not access a Balsamiq Service.

This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.

If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We’re all ears!

We don’t amend this document for any particular customer, but if your changes apply to all of our customers, we’ll be happy to update it for everyone. Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.

We improve this document over time. If the changes are significant, we will provide a prominent notice on our home page, product login screens, or by sending you an email notification. By continuing to use the Service, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.

Your access and use of the Balsamiq Service is always subject to the most current version of this document.

Support
Support for Balsamiq Services is provided via our Community Forums at forums.balsamiq.com as well via our support page.

Email and phone support is also included, but only provided to Owners.

Owners are responsible for first-level support to the people on their Balsamiq Service Site or Space or subscription. If you have an issue with your Balsamiq Service, contact your Owner(s) first.

We continuously update our documentation so that users can help themselves and Owners are better equipped to help their users.

We take pride in providing excellent customer support, but we are also a small team and value our work/life balance. This means that although we’ll try our best, we do not guarantee 24/7 support.

System Requirements
To access our Services, you need a modern web browser (Edge 87+, Chrome 61+, Firefox 78+, Safari 14+) with cookies and javascript enabled.

Your devices have to be able to access our servers on port 443.

Can I Run Your Services behind the Firewall?
Balsamiq for Desktop and our Server Apps can be run behind your firewall. Note that those are governed by a different License Agreement.

For our other Services, the answer is no, and it’s not planned.

Access and Security of Your Data
You can find detailed information on what data we save, how we use it, and how you can access it, correct it and delete it in our Privacy Policy.

We also provide answers to information security questionnaire for each of our Services on our Information Security page.

Any unauthorized use, copying or distribution of the software is expressly prohibited by law, and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Violators will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible.

The trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on the Services are the property of Balsamiq or other third parties.

The rights granted to you constitute a license and not a transfer of title.
Any Balsamiq Materials made available only upon payment of a fee may only be viewed, downloaded and printed subject to your payment of such fee.
Who Owns the IP of My Wireframes and Assets?
User Materials refer to the wireframes and other assets (text, images, photographs, graphics, etc) created or uploaded by users using Balsamiq Services.

Balsamiq does not claim intellectual property rights over User Materials.

For Balsamiq Cloud, we leave it to each Space or Site Owner(s) to decide who should own the IP of User Materials. We encourage Owner(s) to make their policy clear to their users.

You acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq has no liability of any kind should anyone you granted access to your content modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute it, or violate the Terms of Service or other limitations that you may impose on the use User Materials.

Balsamiq does not pre-screen User Materials that users provide or otherwise submit via Balsamiq Services; however, Balsamiq may remove any posted or submitted User Materials from Balsamiq Services for any reason without notice in its sole discretion. By posting or submitting your User Materials, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the intellectual property rights and other rights to your User Materials as described in these Terms of Service, including all the rights necessary for you to post or submit your User Materials.

In addition, by posting or otherwise submitting your User Materials that contain images, photographs, pictures, videos, webcasts or that are otherwise graphical in whole or in part (“Images”), you represent and warrant that: (a) you own the copyright in such Images, or that you have obtained all necessary license(s) from the copyright owner(s) of such Images to use such Images, or portions thereof, in keeping with your use in connection with Balsamiq Services and as otherwise permitted by these Terms of Service; (b) in the event you choose to grant licenses and sublicenses to such Images, you have the rights necessary to grant the licenses and sublicenses described in these Terms of Service; and (c) you have received consent from any and all persons depicted in such Images to use the Images as set forth in these Terms of Service, including the distribution, public display, public performance and reproduction of such Images.

You are solely and entirely responsible for all of your User Materials that you post or otherwise submit via Balsamiq Services. You shall assume all risks associated with the use of your User Materials including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of your User Materials. Balsamiq does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of your User Materials. You acknowledge and agree that by accessing or using Balsamiq Services, you may be exposed to User Materials from others that are offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable.

Reliability
Do You Guarantee That Balsamiq Services Will Be Accessible at All Times?
In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet. We do not offer contracted SLA for availability to Balsamiq Services and your data.

That said, high reliability is something we are proud of and something we deliberately chose to compete on. We have developers, system administrators and support staff on call, 24/7.

We monitor Balsamiq Services closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email and SMS) when a Balsamiq Service is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.

You can see for yourself how we’re doing on this front by looking at status.balsamiq.com.

You acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq shall not be liable for any failure to store your materials on Balsamiq Service at any time.

Play Nice Clauses
Use of Balsamiq Services
You agree that you shall not:

Collect, harvest, mine or engage in any other activity to obtain e-mail addresses, phone numbers, personal information or any other information about others.
Use or attempt to gain access to or use another’s user or company account, password, data, or computer systems or networks connected to any Balsamiq Service server, whether through hacking, password mining or any other means.
Access or attempt to access any material that you are not authorized to access.
Make available any files containing materials where you do not own or control, or have not received the necessary licenses to, all intellectual property rights, rights of privacy and publicity and all other rights in and to such materials.

Disrupt, interfere or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying Balsamiq Services or other affiliated or linked sites, materials or services.

Prepare, compile, use, download or otherwise copy any Balsamiq Service user directory or other user or usage information or any portion thereof, or transmit, provide or otherwise distribute (whether or not for a fee) such directory or information to any third party.
Engage in any chain letters, contests, junk e-mail, pyramid schemes, spamming, surveys or any other duplicative or unsolicited messages (commercial or otherwise).

Use any Balsamiq or Balsamiq Service domain name as a pseudonymous return e-mail address.
Market any goods or services for any business purpose (including advertising and making offers to buy or sell goods or services), unless specifically allowed to do so by Balsamiq.
Materials and Services provided by third parties are governed by separate agreements accompanying such materials and services. Balsamiq offers no guarantees and assumes no responsibility or liability of any type with respect to the third-party services, including any liability resulting from incompatibility between a third-party service, Balsamiq Materials, the Balsamiq Services or another third-party service. You agree that you will not hold Balsamiq responsible or liable with respect to the third-party services.

Special Treatment for Spammers
In the event of your or others’ access to or use of a Balsamiq Service or Materials in connection with the transmission of spam unsolicited e-mail or postings in violation of these Terms of Service, you acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq would be irreparably harmed thereunder and that monetary damages would be an insufficient and ineffective remedy; therefore you agree that Balsamiq is entitled to obtain immediate injunctive relief against any such transmission (in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity). Balsamiq may without restriction block, filter or delete unsolicited e-mail.

Subdomain Squatting
For our Services that allow you to specify a subdomain, you may not engage in subdomain squatting. Service accounts that are inactive for more than 6 months may also be removed without further notice. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be subdomain squatting are:

the number Service accounts created
creating Service accounts for the purpose of preventing others from using those account names
creating Service accounts for the purpose of selling those accounts
Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for Service subdomains are also violations and may result in permanent account suspension.

Payment, Cancellation, and Deletion
We offer free 30-day trials for all of our subscription Services. Upon the conclusion of the trial, a paid subscription is required for continued use of our Services.

In the event of failed payment, cancellation of a subscription, or no payment for a trial account, the Service will become inactive. The Owner, who is solely responsible, can cancel their subscription Service at any time directly via the app. An email or phone request to cancel a subscription is not considered cancellation.

In some instances, we will keep the inactive Service account for at least 30 days before deleting it from our system. This includes free accounts with no activity in the past 12 months, which will be deemed inactive and subject to deletion.

Additionally, we reserve the right to discontinue the Balsamiq Services at any time. In this event, Balsamiq will announce an End-Of-Life date on the Balsamiq website. For subscription Services, the End-Of-Life date will be at least 12 months after the announcement date. Balsamiq will honor the terms of this Agreement until the End-Of-Life date. Should an Owner's paid subscription exceed the End-Of-Life date, Balsamiq will offer a refund for any unused time. At the End-Of-Life date, this Agreement will terminate.

Restriction and Termination of Use
We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Balsamiq Services at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you. To this day, we have never had to do this, and we hope it never happens.

If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use the Balsamiq Service automatically terminates. Any materials downloaded or printed from the Balsamiq Service in violation of the Terms of Service must be immediately destroyed.

If you think we removed your access by mistake, get in touch and we’ll give you our reasoning.

Notification of Copyright Infringement
Balsamiq will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of users who infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Balsamiq will investigate notices of copyright infringement and take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512©(2) (“DMCA”).

If you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is occurring on a Balsamiq Service or on sites linked to from Balsamiq Services, please provide written notification of claimed copyright infringement to the designated agent for Balsamiq, which must contain the following elements:

A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest that is alleged to have been infringed;
A description of the copyrighted work or works that you claim have been infringed and identification of what content in such work(s) is claimed to be infringing and which you request to be removed or access to which is to be disabled;
A description of where the content that you claim is infringing is located on Balsamiq Service;
Information sufficient to permit Balsamiq to contact you, such as your physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the content identified in your Notice in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
A statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.
Balsamiq’s designated agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached here.

Links to Third Party Sites
Balsamiq Services may include links that will take you to other sites outside of the Balsamiq Service. The linked sites are provided by Balsamiq to you or the creators of the wireframes as a convenience and the inclusion of the links do not imply any endorsement by Balsamiq of any linked site. Balsamiq has no control of the linked sites and you therefore acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq is not responsible for the contents of any linked site, any link contained in a linked site or any changes or updates to a linked site. You further acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq is not responsible for any form of transmission (e.g. webcasting) received from any linked site.

Advertisements and Promotions
Balsamiq may run advertisements and promotions from third parties via Balsamiq Services or Materials in any manner or mode and to any extent. Your communications, activities, relationships and business dealings with any third parties advertising or promoting via Balsamiq Services or Materials, including payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, shall be solely matters between you and such third parties. You acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such non-Balsamiq advertisers on Balsamiq Services or Materials.

Publicity Rights
(a) The Owner grants Balsamiq the right to include the Owner's organization as a customer in Product promotional material.

(b) The Owner can deny Balsamiq this right by submitting a written request via email to sales@balsamiq.com, requesting to be excluded from Product promotional material.

(c) Should the Owner come to be or already be included in Product promotional material, as a result of any prior purchases where the Owner did not request exclusion from Product promotional material, the Owner can at any point in time, submit a written request via email to sales@balsamiq.com to have Balsamiq remove the Owner's organization name from Product promotional material. Upon receipt of such request, Balsamiq will remove any reference to the organization from such promotional material within 30 days and make no further reference to it.
