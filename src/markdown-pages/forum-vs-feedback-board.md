# If your business makes stuff, no matter what kind of stuff, there's a good chance you could benefit from one of these systems.

**But which one?**  Traditionally, manufacturing software solutions like ERP, MRP and MES have been expensive, custom products that take months or even years to implement.  The significant time and money investment to implement one or more of these systems puts them out of reach for most small to mid-sized businesses.  In the place of a proper solution, a jumble of Excel spreadsheets and paper forms fill the gap.

If this sounds familiar, it is time to revisit how a software solution can help streamline and grow your manufacturing business.

## What is ERP?

ERP or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning" target="_blank">**Enterprise Resource Planning**</a> software encompasses the broadest range of business planning, covering everything from HR to distribution. An ERP system is designed to connect all aspects of a business enterprise together so it can operate in one cohesive unit. The ERP system is most commonly used in large businesses where coordination across accounting, planning, HR, customer service and manufacturing is required. 

**ERP features:**

- Human Resources (HR)
- Accounting
- Customer relationship management (CRM)
- Orders
- Inventory status
- Material use
- Shipping and distribution

Because of the cost and complexity of maintaining these systems, smaller businesses will often forego the ERP in favor of a more focused system and start with MRP.

## What is MRP?

An MRP system or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_requirements_planning" target="_blank">**Material Requirements Planning**</a> system provides a way to manage your manufacturing resources as efficiently as possible. This means keeping track of inventory levels, production schedules and shipments.

The MRP system is responsible for accepting an order and checking that materials are on hand.  Once material availability is verified, the order will be scheduled for production.  The system should schedule in the most efficient manner to optimize employee and machinery time.  Once complete, the system will dispatch the order to shipping or a warehouse.

The MRP should also provide insight into resource utilization, providing direction to further optimize the business resources.

**MRP features:**

- Move order to production
- Check inventory or materials are available
- Schedule order for production
- Dispatch finished goods

## What is MES?

The MES or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_execution_system" target="_blank">**Manufacturing Execution System**</a> handles shop floor operations once a job has been scheduled for production.  This system will be responsible for the details of the manufacturing process, and is used to maximize efficiency and quality of the goods.

As the product passes through the shop floor, the MES will guide each step of the process. Details such as when a process step starts and ends, how much material is used and what machine or tool is used are all captured in the system.  Yield and operational efficiency can then be calculated from the data.

Quality controls can also put in place and recorded into the system, ensuring the product meets the required specifications. All these data points can then be analyzed in real time, ensuring mistakes are caught and maximum operational efficiency is achieved.

MES systems have traditionally been out of reach for small to mid-size manufacturers since they are typically customized to the specific manufacturing operation, and very expensive. Recently, however, cloud-based software have entered the market, bringing with it flexibility, scale, and affordability.

**MES features:**

- Process tracking
- Material use at each step
- Time tracking for machines and people
- Quality control
- Work in progress (WIP)

## Does ERP, MRP or MES fit my small manufacturing business?

Deciding which system is right for you will come down to the resources available and the scope of your business.

**ERP is most applicable to larger businesses that need to maintain organization and efficiency across a large organization** with many employees, locations and warehouses.  Tying all this together is expensive, and requires significant time and training across the organization.  Because of these requirements, most small manufacturers are better served with MRP systems.  

>ERP manages logistics at a high level, while MRP connects planning and accounting to the ground floor - where the core of your manufacturing business resides.

**The MRP system is aligned perfectly with the core of the manufacturing business,** the physical products.  This is where your manufacturing business is focused and where your business can make real gains in efficiency.  The MRP will give you important insight directly into your inventory, order-to-ship time and cost of goods.  This in turn, enables faster and more accurate decisions on inventory, quotes and hiring.  

Digging deeper, many small manufacturers also struggle with quality or traceability issues, and this is where MES comes in.

>MRP does the planning and sets the stage for MES, which handles the details of the production process. MES tracks the technical aspects of your process, ensuring quality and traceability.

**The MES system is especially applicable to industries where quality and traceability are important.**  Examples of this include technical products, perishable goods, or laboratory specimens.  These products require a high level of very specific data tracking and collection that will not be covered by a standalone MRP system.

By utilizing data forms, machine metrics, employee logging, and material tracking for every process step, a detailed map of each product is created. This provides the necessary data to maintain quality, traceability and regulatory compliance.

While MES is most important for technical manufacturers, **every manufacturer will benefit from an MES system** and the added traceability it offers.  The good news is that these systems are no longer out of reach for small businesses and can be found as a part of many smart manufacturing software platforms!

## Smart Manufacturing Software = MRP + MES

Smart Manufacturing software merges MRP and MES into an effective solution for small manufacturers. By combining elements of both MRP and MES, this type of solution offers the most valuable aspects of managing a manufacturing organization, providing a platform for order, inventory, and production management.

But what about the cost?  MES systems are notoriously expensive, so why would a Smart Manufacturing system be any different? Enter Jetline, a cost effective solution that will help even the smallest manufacturer increase efficiency, resource utilization and ultimately margins. From order creation to product delivery and all the steps in between, Jetline provide the tools so that small manufacturers can manage their operation, in a clear, modern interface that streamlines work for operators to engineers to owners.
